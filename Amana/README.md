## Why Amana ? 

The ancient name for the Ohm River in Hessen, Germany, was Amana.


Here are the key historical details:

- First Record: The river was first mentioned in historical documents around 750–779 AD as "super ripam fluminis Amana" (on the banks of the river Amana).

- Etymology: The name likely comes from the Proto-Indo-European root am- or ama-, which means "riverbed" or "natural watercourse." Some historians also suggest a Celtic origin from the word Amonā.

- Connection to Amöneburg: The town of Amöneburg, which sits on a hill overlooking the river, derives its name from this old river name. In the year 721 AD, it was recorded as Amanaburch when Saint Boniface visited the area to establish a monastery.
    
- Evolution: Over centuries, the name Amana evolved through various forms (such as Amana, Amene, and Omen) before settling into the modern German name Ohm.
