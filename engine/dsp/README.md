I have some optional ImGui / OhmFlux UI-Stuff included. 
But it basicly can be used in every Project. 

- OverDrive guitar effect like 
- Bit Crusher "Lo-Fi" Filter
- Chorus 
- Delay 
- Single Band Equilizer
- 9 Band Equilizer
- Limiter
- Reverb
- Ring Modulator
- (old) Soundcard emulation 
- Spectrum Analyzter (basic)
- Visual Analyzter for VU Meter and Oszi
- Voice Modulator 
- Warmth a One-Pole Low-Pass Filter

- *TODO* Panning
- *TODO* Chromatic Tuner
- *TODO* Filter (LPF/HPF)
- *TODO* Noise Gate 

- Normalizer for export to Wav
