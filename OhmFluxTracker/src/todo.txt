TODO Version 1 (i do not use 0 this time):


[ ] OPL Effects
 [ ] add speed modifier (need to handle the speed with is set on playSong - state bpm ... )
 [ ] how to editor then the best way => Popup with control's



[ ] Bank editor
  [X] save
  [X] load
  [X] new (append)
  [ ] add ==> from file and selection if a bank
    [ ] convert some of my instrumens => xxd -i file and add them to OPL3Instruments
    [ ] array of default bank names
    [ ] add menu to select a default instrument to append
  [X] delete
  [X] move

 [ ] keyboard shortcuts ... cleanup !!!
     * some are in keyboardGui,
     * some in songGui
     * and ESC is handles in ohmFluxTrackerGui

[ ] Editing
 [ ] paste to a new pattern
 [ ] save clipboard as preset (maybe 10 presets or so )
     ==> need a clipboard  to json so i also can save selection as file or in settings


[ ] live playing << MUST have ~~ works a bit ;)
  [ ] row cursor must react to the playing or not ?! << in FluxEditor it stucks when it followed in edit mode
  [~] first: add a custom stop note (so a STOP_NOTE is added to the pattern ) => use space !
      ONLY IN LIVE PLAYING
  [ ] play pattern starts when first note is pressed

[ ] FileBrowser
 [ ] try a better file browser this sucks and is for testing only
        => ImFileDialog (MIT) <<< NOT i tried to modify it to get it work but no look so far (C++20)
 [ ] it display the full filename and does not change directory
 [ ] if no extension is given is save nothing ?
 [ ] it just crashed when trying to change the filename ^^
 [ ] recent files

[ ] modify console (buttons and search on top consume  too much space)

[ ] Undo (should i simply make an array (10 or so) of SongData ?! memory should not be a problem in these days)

[ ] Make it nice with buttons (icons) ==> in progress


[ ] create a icon
[ ] test if windows compile works ;) - hey it runs on windows, too :P
[ ] Make a Release 1.xx

------------------
[X] dspGUI / DSP for all Effects .... bss << update gui controls ,,, then
  [X] BitCrusher
  [X] Chorus
  [X] Equilizer9Band
  [X] Limiter
  [X] Reverb
  [~] SoundCardEmulation
  [X] Warmth


  [X] Limiter:  reverse does not longer work .. i guess because of CUSTOM !!
  [X] for gui stepper we need :
    like i did in Limiter

     auto operator<=>(const LimiterSettings&) const = default; //C++20 lazy way


   ==> THIS ... TODO !!
  static const std::array<DSP::LimiterSettings, 6> LIMITER_PRESETS = {
      DSP::LIMITER_CUSTOM,  // Index 0: << add dummy!
      DSP::LIMITER_DEFAULT, // Index 1
      DSP::LIMITER_EIGHTY,  // Index 2
      DSP::LIMITER_FIFTY,   // Index 3
      DSP::LIMITER_LOWVOL,  // Index 4
      DSP::LIMITER_EXTREM   // Index 5
  };

  [X] and something like that:

        int currentIdx = 0; // Standard: "Custom"

        for (int i = 1; i < DSP::LIMITER_PRESETS.size(); ++i) {
            if (currentSettings == DSP::LIMITER_PRESETS[i]) {
                currentIdx = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        int displayIdx = currentIdx;  //<< keep currentIdx clean

        ....
            if (ImFlux::ValueStepper("##Preset", &displayIdx, presetNames, IM_ARRAYSIZE(presetNames))) {
                if (displayIdx > 0 && displayIdx < DSP::LIMITER_PRESETS.size()) {
                            lim->setSettings(DSP::LIMITER_PRESETS[displayIdx]);
                }
            }
        .....

[X] filename handling / overwrite dialog and such [useless] stuff
 [X] New pattern slider : cant select the right size
 [X] Piano: black keys does not stop
 [X] Pattern Tabs selected hard to see
 [X] play selected:
    [X] Button Icon
    [X] should ignore a single cell select
    [X] F2 as key

 [X] Pattern: delete (also update order list)
 [~] Pattern editor follow
     [~] check mCurrentSong is playing (via pointer? )
     [~] not when exporting ! ==> why looks funny :P
 [X] * reset bank icon
 [~] * rename instrument => instrument editor
 [X] * export bank .. Which format(s) ....wopl+own i guess => yes fmb3 and wopl

[X] Limiter settings (maybe only Threshold )
 [X] only select defaults


[~] change fms3 format again :P better now than later
   the data should be optional check EOF !
   [~] save / load ALL the DSP effects
         i dont care the filesize (some bytes)
         so i store the settings also if it's off.

[~] Channel Menu => set instrument (or do i use selection ?!) need a menu for seletion too

[X] OrderList Editor


 [X] Volume and panning should be not overwritten all the time ... not sure how (effects)

 [X] Insertmode
   [X] to keyboard gui ==> NEW LED :D and namespace ImFlux!
   [X] only when window is visible

 [X] Instrument Colors: Do not render the name !! and center the text again
     (better a small rect with color)
     Color should be also shown in Instrument List

 [X] CellPopup:
     check insert and shift makes no sense there ?!
     - delete and shift is wrong call copy&paste i guess

 [X] Paste is broken if copied from a longer pattern and paste into
     example copy column of 256 row pattern into 63 row pattern
     I thougth it's fixed but still paste still sucks sometimes.


[X] current 2026-01-27
 [X] new pattern added as 02 but is 01!
 [X] reverse selected  does paste reverse ? => sort was broken
 [X] play pattern  plays single (selected)
 [X] right mouse always use selected cell ==> fixed for paste (useContextPoint)
 [X] Added Icons Font mIconFont ++ ICON_FA_...
 [X] colored step cell rendering
 [X] need change instrument !! for channel or better selection

[X] Add Soundrender to DSP window and also to effects (not in Controller directly)
[X] table drives me crazy lol >> look at IMGui demo of AssetBrowser  => it's ok for me now
[X] Pattern with mColCount instead of fixed for copy paste / template
[X] instrument select combo => Widget_InstrumentCombo
[X] New Song add a default Pattern
[X] OPL3Controller => play pattern WITH active channel only  -> ticktrigger i guess
[~] reset pattern - i need this for sure :) => ctrl+a :P
[~] set default instrument / step for each channel / also an octave ?! << bullshit
[X] select a rect with mouse or shift cursor : shift up/down = row select and ctrl shift cell select
[X] del should reset the selected (one cell or rect cells)
[X] ctrl+x
[X] ctrl+a
[X] ctrl+c copy mPatternClipBoard
[X] ctrl+v paste
[X] ctrl + del delete rows using selection
[X] ctrl + ins insert using selection
[X] ctrl+up transpose up
[X] ctrl+down transpose down
[X] ctrl+pageup transpose octave up
[X] ctrl+pagedown octave transpose down
